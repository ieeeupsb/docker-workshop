# Writing docker-compose.yml

## Introduction
We'll be understaind how a `docker-compose.yml` file workds.

## Step 1: Understanding docker-compose.yml
The `docker-compose.yml` file is used to define and configure multiple services that make up an application and their interconnections. Let's break down the structure of this file:

```yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ./db/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  backend:
    build: ./backend
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      FLASK_APP: app.py
      FLASK_RUN_HOST: 0.0.0.0
    depends_on:
      - db

  frontend:
    image: nginx:alpine
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/usr/share/nginx/html
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    depends_on:
      - backend

volumes:
  db-data:

networks:
  default:
    driver: bridge
```

## Step 2: Defining Services
- The `services` section is where you define the different components of your application.
- Each service is identified by a unique name (e.g., `db`, `backend`, `frontend`).

## Step 3: Configuring Services
- For each service, you can specify various configurations such as the Docker image to use, volume mounts, environment variables, ports to expose, etc.
- For example, the `db` service uses the `postgres:latest` image, mounts volumes for data persistence, sets environment variables for database configuration, and exposes port `5432` for database access.

## Step 4: Service Dependencies
- You can specify dependencies between services using the `depends_on` directive.
- In this example, the `backend` service depends on the `db` service, ensuring that the database is available before the backend starts.

## Step 5: Volumes and Networks
- The `volumes` section defines named volumes for persistent data storage.
- The `networks` section configures the network driver for communication between services.

## Step 6: Writing Your Own docker-compose.yml
To write your own `docker-compose.yml` file:
1. Identify the services your application requires (e.g., database, backend, frontend).
2. For each service, specify the necessary configurations such as image, volumes, ports, environment variables, etc.
3. Define any dependencies between services using the `depends_on` directive.
4. Optionally, configure volumes and networks for data storage and network communication.

## Step 7: Running the docker compose

To run the docker compose you can use the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose build //builds the images
docker-compose up //runs the images
docker-compose down //stop and removes the containers
```

This is how to write a `docker-compose.yml` file to define and configure services for a multi-service application.
