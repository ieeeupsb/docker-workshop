# Docker Workshop

This is a simple docker workshop to explain the basics of docker and docker compose. We all have a hands-on approach that can be seen in the guides. You can use the hands-on 1 and hands-on 2 to try it out.

You can find the guide [here](./docs/guide.md).

In the same way, you can find the slides [here](./docs/slides.pdf) (the slides can also be viewed in markdown however marp is necessary for it).

Finally, there is also a cheat sheet with the commands you are going to need for the workshop, you can get it from [here](./docs/cheat_sheet.pdf).

If you find ant typo or error, or even a suggestion feel free to create a pull request. Keep in mind that this is a simple workshop and there might be more advanced/efficient ways to perform the same actions.

## Folder structure

In docs you can find the documentation for the workshop, mainly the slides (in pdf or md) and the presentation (in md). you can also find a cheat sheet with the commands an basic explanations of how to create a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml

In hands_on_1 there are files to run a single docker container, it uses python and flask to create a simple webpage.

In hands_on_2 there are filesto run a docker-compose app. The app itself is still just a simple webpage, however it contains the intereaction between frontend, backend and database.
